In my role, I would support my local community by assisting with local events and helping the less abled people.\nAs a result of working so hard during my time with the cadets, in 2016 I was awarded with the Jack Petchey award which acknowledges the great work that young people do. \n\nI also have 5 years experience in providing amazing customer service.  Throughout my three years at university I have managed to hold down a part time job as well as volunteering for 2 amazing charities. \n\nHaving gained so much experience with knowing how to work with people, I realised a big motivation of mine is for me to be in a position where I can provide a memorable service to people, and make them leave feeling motivated and uplifted. I think especially over this period of lockdown, I have been extremely fortunate to have my family and friends around me, however I understand that this is not the situation for everyone.",

In secondary school in Nigeria, I was one of only 3 students to achieve the DELF B2 Level Certificate. DELF is a French institute that awards certificates to young people for their proficiency in speaking and writing the French Language. I’m not really sure what makes me stand out at the moment but it’s something I plan on discovering soon. A quality I think I tend to have is resilience and the ability to push on even in difficult circumstances. I’m an avid football fan and I support Manchester United 😁",

Finally, in my final year, I did an internship with Goldman sachs in the Asset Management division. Through these experiences, I have learnt resilience and the important to adapt which has become more important than ever before as we are faced with the current pandemic and the changes it has brought globally.

This also reflects to my attitude with work I am always open to learn, if I do not understand I will ask or even go out of my way to research to make sure I am best I can be for the role. Even in my current role administering pensions at an insurance firm, I am in conversations with financial advisors, members, receiving schemes, essentially I tap into the knowledge I gain from the job on a daily basis and look further into them to improve my own understanding, ensuring I can work efficiently.",

    "How would you describe yourself?": "I am a driven and adaptable individual. I am well organised and have good attention to detail. Before enrolling into university, I had experience working as a sales support administrator for Rebound Electronics. This role entailed building rapport with suppliers and customers worldwide as well as using negotiation skills to achieve the best possible price for the electronic components being sold. During my time over the summer of 2018, I was responsible for sourcing an entire list that a customer had asked for. This included parts that were obsolete as well as expensive. I had to contact a range of suppliers globally and create a quote in an efficient amount of time to better the chances for a sale. During university, I have worked in a number of roles which have all been customer facing. This has helped with my confidence in speaking as well as being an active listener if a customer is dissatisfied with a product or service. I also cheer competitively and I am looking to launch a small business on the side as a hobby.",

Being awarded a Laidlaw scholarship in 2019, quickly learnt about politics after being funded to research the implications of the nation-state law in Israel and Palestine; through my degree and extra-curricular interests I am now passionate about sustainability. I completed an internship this summer with the UN SDG2 hub, and was commissioned by Tortoise Media to write an article on the climate crisis and liberalism. I am now looking to apply to the civil service fast stream, as well as consultancy firms such as Oliver Wyman, Bain, BCG and Mckinsey to have impact in sustainability.",
